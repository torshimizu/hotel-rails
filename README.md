# README

Wanted to practice Rails, so I took our Ada Developer's Academy [Hotel](https://github.com/torshimizu/hotel) project and turned it into a Rails application!

So far, I have set up the application to create, manage, and track reservations, but will work on adding reserving blocks of rooms in the future.

The CSS in the project is limited as I wanted to focus on the logic and set up in rails (linking models, multiple controllers, etc).
